# Hack4Gaza
NanoMedic is our solution to for Hack4Gaza:

## Description:
NanoMedic is a mobile app that works offline to identify different types of wounds (currently implemented) and once identified by our classification machine learning model, the app will give treatment methods (including unconventional methods)  to the user on how to treat the condition.

This app is meant for medical students and civilians who donâ€™t have little or no medical knowledge compared to a medical doctor. This is because in Gaza, there is a major shortage of doctors and any remaining hospitals are at maximum capacity. This app is meant for LESS SEVERE situations.
